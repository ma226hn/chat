# Chat App

## Application requirement
-Node.js
-express
-socket.io
-dec-enc-lib


## Application advantages
- Application using pure javascript , express,node and socket.io .
- application can send just text message between  the participate in the same room 
- Application send notify when a new participate join in the room and when one letÂ´ft and when one write .
- Users receive just message from the same room chat.
- Users send message to the members in the same room chat .
- User can create a new chatroom.
- user can join to the existing chatroom.
- Users know who send the message
- Application provide decryption and encryption .
## Application  development 
- Sending an error message when the user wants to join a non-existent room instead of creating a new room
- add a  voice call and video call to the chat.
- add the ability to send and receive photos.
- add database to save the conversations and the participates.
## Application problem 
 - When using (dec-enc-lib) library i could'nt use import from the node module so i added the library manuel (dec-enc-lib) to the client folder
